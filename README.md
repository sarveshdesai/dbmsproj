# Java MySQL Database Application

This is a simple Java application that demonstrates how to connect to a MySQL database using JDBC. The application connects to a local MySQL database, performs database operations (such as querying or updating), and handles SQL exceptions.

## Features

- **JDBC Connection**: The application establishes a connection to a MySQL database using the JDBC driver.
- **SQL Queries**: Interacts with a MySQL database, potentially allowing data manipulation and retrieval.
- **Exception Handling**: Catches and handles SQL and ClassNotFound exceptions.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or above.
- **MySQL**: Ensure MySQL is installed and running locally.
- **JDBC Driver**: The MySQL JDBC driver (`com.mysql.jdbc.Driver`) must be included in the project.
- **Database Setup**: A MySQL database with the schema `v_project` and user credentials as defined in the code.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sarveshdesai/java-mysql-app.git
   ```
   
2. **Install MySQL** and create the required database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE v_project;
   ```

3. **Modify Database Credentials**:
   Update the following line in the `App.java` file with your MySQL username and password:
   ```java
   Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/v_project", "root", "1234");
   ```

4. **Compile the Java program**:
   ```bash
   javac App.java
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   java App
   ```

## Code Overview

The main steps in the program include:

- **Loading the JDBC driver**:
  ```java
  Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
  ```

- **Connecting to the database**:
  ```java
  Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/v_project", "root", "1234");
  ```

- **Handling Exceptions**:
  Proper handling for `ClassNotFoundException` and `SQLException` is implemented:
  ```java
  catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
  }
  ```
